Procedure: 
1> we are using mmap  to  take chunk of data from file and storing it in bufferA and bufferB
2> we do this process till block of row time
3> then we call open mp on stored data and perform matrix multiplication
4> data is stored back to file







Instructions To Run Program:
1>we have to give Total row ,chunk size , block of row and no of thread as input
2> Total Row should be multiple of 2
3> chunk size should be multiple of 2 
4> block of row should be factor of Total Row
5> no of thread should be1,2,4,8,......etc...


output:
1> Gflops for floating point operation
2> time taken to multiply one block
4> Total time taken
