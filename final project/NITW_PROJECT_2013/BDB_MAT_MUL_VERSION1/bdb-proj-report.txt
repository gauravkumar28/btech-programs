Berkely Data Base provide huge APIs for c/c++  languages to work on BIG DATA.
It has many built in API for Many Compiler.
1> We First Created the DataBase. 
2> Then we inserted (key,data) pair
3> DataBase is Stored in BTree type structure so  that we can get sequential access;
4> using Cursur_set function we are seting the index and then accessing sequential data and then perform mat. multiplication
5> then resultent Matrix is displayed.


Problems  Observed:
1> As for storing data we need (key,data) so selecting unique key was big problem. if key is not unique collision will take place.
2> I was trying to store integer unique key but it was stored as ascii value so  key was same after multiple of 255.
3> I request you to resolve the key related problem so can we can store and access large data  and can get good performance
4> My code is giving current result upto Matrix Size 15x15  above that it gives Segmentation fault.So look in That also
